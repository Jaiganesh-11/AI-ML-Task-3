## 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression techniques using the Housing dataset. The goal is to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and furnishing status.

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
1. Python
2. Pandas for data manipulation
3. Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
4. Matplotlib for visualization

### 📌 Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
    Handled categorical features using one-hot encoding
    Checked for missing values and ensured all inputs were numeric
2. Model Building
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets
    Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression
3. Model Evaluation
  Evaluated using:
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    R² Score
4. Model Interpretation
    Displayed model coefficients and intercept to understand feature influence
    Visualized the relationship between actual and predicted prices
